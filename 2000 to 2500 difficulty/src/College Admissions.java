/*

Explanation of code : 

This Java code solves a college allocation problem involving student preferences and college rankings, using efficient I/O and a greedy approach. 

üß† Problem Idea:
You are given:

N colleges with their ranks (collegeRank[1...N])

M students with their exam ranks and college preference lists.

Students are assigned to their most preferred available college with the best (lowest) rank.

Chef is always student ID 1. You need to output which college Chef gets after all higher-ranked students have chosen.

üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview:
Fast I/O Classes:

FastReader is used for fast input via DataInputStream.

BufferedWriter is used for fast output.

Input Parsing:

collegeRank[i]: rank of the i-th college.

posOfRank[r]: student ID whose exam-rank is r.

prefs[i]: preference list of student i.

Student Processing:

For each student in exam-rank order (from 1 to M):

Choose the best unfilled college from their preferences (lowest college rank).

Mark that college as filled.

If it‚Äôs Chef‚Äôs turn (student ID 1), store and print his allocated college.

‚úÖ Key Points:
Greedy selection ensures students get their best possible college.

Chef‚Äôs result is output immediately once he is processed.

Optimized for large inputs.

This approach efficiently simulates a preference-based allocation system using simple arrays and conditions.
