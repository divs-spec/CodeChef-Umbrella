/*
Explanation of the code : 

This Java code solves the problem of finding the shortest subarray to remove so that the remaining array has all elements from 1 to n exactly once.

üß† Problem Setup:
You're given an array a[] of length m, filled with values between 1 and n.

The goal is to remove the smallest number of elements (as a continuous subarray), so that the remaining array is a complete set: every number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

üîç How It Works:
Suffix preparation (back[]):

Scans from right to left to find the smallest suffix (ending part) where all n numbers appear at least once.

r becomes the starting index of this suffix.

Prefix processing (front[]):

Goes from left to right, trying to remove a prefix and shrink the remaining suffix further.

Keeps track of seen elements in the front and adjusts the suffix start r so that:

There are no duplicate elements

All n unique values are still covered.

Answer calculation:

At each point, the minimal total number of elements removed from start and end is tracked.

‚úÖ Output:
The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to meet the condition.

It uses two-pointer sliding window logic and frequency maps for an efficient solution.
