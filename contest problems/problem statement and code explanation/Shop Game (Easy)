Overview:
This Java program solves a problem related to binary strings and selecting the most valuable elements based on a cost. 
The idea is to maximize the total cost by picking the top K elements, possibly adjusting the selection under certain conditions.

Step-by-step Explanation:
Input Reading:

First, the program reads the number of test cases T.

For each test case, it reads:

Two integers: N (length of the array) and K (number of elements to pick).

An array of integers called cost of size N.

A binary string A of length N.

Flip and Reverse Logic:

If the K-th character (1-indexed) of string A is '1', we:

Flip the binary string: '0' becomes '1', and '1' becomes '0'.

Reverse the cost array.

This ensures we always handle the case when A[K-1] is '0'.

Counting Trailing Zeros:

The program counts how many continuous '0' characters appear just before and including index K-1 from the right.

This count c is used to calculate blocked = K - c + 1, which defines a "blocked region" — the last blocked elements of the array must be handled specially.

Picking Top K Costs:

The program stores (cost, index) pairs in a list and sorts them in descending order of cost.

It then picks the top K elements and calculates their total cost.

It also keeps track of the indices of these selected items using a Set.

Checking the Blocked Region:

The program checks whether all indices in the blocked region (last blocked positions) are included in the top K selection.

If any are missing, we don’t need to adjust.

If all are present, we try to swap out the cheapest one in that region with a more expensive one outside (if possible) to increase the total.

Swapping Logic (if needed):

Find the smallest cost among selected items within the blocked region.

Find the largest cost among the items not selected.

If we can improve by swapping the two, do so by updating the total cost.

Print Final Answer:

Print the total % MOD (with MOD = 1_000_000_007) to handle large numbers.

Helper Functions:
flipBinary(String A):

Converts every '0' in the string to '1', and every '1' to '0'.

reverse(int[] arr):

Reverses the elements of the cost array.

In Simple Words:
For each test case:

You have a cost array and a binary string.

You want to pick K values from the array with the highest cost.

But if a certain bit is '1', you flip the string and reverse the costs.

There's a special region at the end that might force some elements to be included.

If the forced elements are all in your selection, you try to swap the weakest one out for a stronger one elsewhere.

Finally, print the best total cost possible.
