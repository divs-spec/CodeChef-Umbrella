Count Odd Even Divisors
You are given an integer N, and you need to calculate:

The number of odd divisors of N

The number of even divisors of N

Example
For N = 2, the divisors are: {1, 2} → 1 odd (1), 1 even (2)

For N = 8, the divisors are: {1, 2, 4, 8} → 1 odd (1), 3 even (2, 4, 8)

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain a single integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line two integers:

First: the number of odd divisors of N

Second: the number of even divisors of N

Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑇 ≤ 100
1≤N≤100

Sample Input:

8
Sample Output :
1 0
1 1
2 0
1 2
