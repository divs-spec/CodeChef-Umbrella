Problem Statement :
 
Movie Hype

Chef goes to a movie theater with 2N + 1 seats in a row.
Seats numbered 1, 3, 5, …, 2N + 1 are occupied
Seats numbered 2, 4, 6, …, 2N are empty
Chef can sit in any empty seat.
Hype Levels
The person sitting in seat 1 has hype level A₁
The person sitting in seat 3 has hype level A₂

…

The person sitting in seat 2N + 1 has hype level Aₙ₊₁
Loudness Rule
The loudness of an empty seat is the maximum hype level of the two people sitting next to it.

Example:
Loudness of seat 2 = max(hype of seat 1, hype of seat 3)
Loudness of seat 4 = max(hype of seat 3, hype of seat 5)

Goal
Chef wants to choose an empty seat with the minimum loudness.

Input
Number of test cases T
For each test case:
An integer N
N + 1 integers representing hype levels

Output
For each test case, print one number: the minimum loudness possible.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ hype level ≤ 100

Code Explanation :

First, the program reads an integer T, which is the number of test cases. 
For each test case, it reads an integer N. After that, it reads N + 1 integers into an array A. 
This means the array has one more element than N.
The goal of the program is to examine every pair of consecutive elements in the array. 
For each pair A[i] and A[i+1], it calculates the larger value between the two using max(A[i], A[i+1]). 
This value represents the “cost” or “value” of that adjacent pair.
As it checks each adjacent pair, the program keeps track of the smallest such maximum value. 
It starts with ans set to a very large number (INT_MAX) and updates it whenever a smaller maximum is found.
After all adjacent pairs have been processed, ans contains the minimum possible value among all pair-wise maximums. 
The program then prints this value as the result for the current test case.
In simple terms, the program looks at all neighboring pairs in the array, finds the bigger number in each pair, and finally outputs the smallest of those bigger numbers. 
This process is repeated for every test case.
