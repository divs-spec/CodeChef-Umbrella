Problem Statement :

Front–Back Matching

You are given a string S of length N, consisting only of lowercase English letters.
You are allowed to rearrange the characters of S in any order.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible, after rearranging the string, to make the first and last characters of S the same.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
    The first line contains an integer N, the length of the string.
    The second line contains the string S of length N.

Output Format
For each test case, print Yes or No on a new line, depending on whether it is possible to rearrange the string so that the first and last characters are equal.
The output is case-insensitive, so any of the following are accepted:
yes, YES, yEs, etc.

Code Explanation :
First, it reads the number of test cases. 
For every test case, it takes an integer N (the length of the string) and the string S.
If the length of the string is 1, the program immediately prints “Yes”. 
This is a special rule defined by the problem, so no further checking is needed in this case.
For strings longer than one character, the program counts how many times each letter appears in the string. 
Since the string only contains lowercase English letters, it uses an array of size 26, where each position represents one letter from 'a' to 'z'. 
As the program goes through the string, it increases the count for each character it sees.
After counting, the program checks the frequency array to see if any character appears at least twice. 
If even one character has a frequency of 2 or more, it means the string contains a repeated character, so the program prints “Yes”.
If all characters appear exactly once, then there are no duplicates in the string, and the program prints “No”.
In short, the program answers “Yes” if the string has at least one repeated character (or if its length is 1), otherwise it answers “No”.
