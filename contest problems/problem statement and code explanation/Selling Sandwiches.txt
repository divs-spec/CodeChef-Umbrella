👨‍🍳 What is the problem about?
Chef sells sandwiches. He earns money by selling them but also spends money to make them.

Each sandwich is sold for A rupees.

To make one sandwich, Chef spends:

B rupees on buns

C rupees on vegetables

Now you are asked:

How much profit or loss does Chef make for one sandwich?

💡 How to think about it?
To find profit or loss, you simply do this:

Profit = Money Chef gets from selling - Money Chef spends on making

So in this case:

Profit = A - (B + C)

If the result is positive, Chef is making a profit.

If the result is negative, Chef is making a loss.

📘 Example 1
Let’s say:

A = 1000 (selling price)

B = 200 (bun cost)

C = 200 (vegetable cost)

Chef spends 200 + 200 = 400 to make the sandwich
He sells it for 1000
So, his profit = 1000 - 400 = 600

📘 Example 2
Let’s say:

A = 100 (selling price)

B = 200 (bun cost)

C = 200 (vegetable cost)

Chef spends 400 to make the sandwich
He sells it for 100
So, his loss = 100 - 400 = -300

✅ Final Goal
You just have to:

Take the three numbers (A, B, C) as input

Calculate: A - (B + C)

Print the answer (which shows profit or loss)
