🧩 Problem Statement (in plain words):
You are given a list of scores for a student in N different tests.

Your task is to decide:

Did the student ever fall below an average score of 40 at any point?

Important rule:

The student is considered to fail if the average score from the first test up to any point is less than 40.

You need to output:

"No" → if the student fails at any point

"Yes" → if the average never drops below 40

🧠 Approach (How to think about it):
As you read the scores one by one, keep a running total.

After each new score, calculate the current average of all scores so far.

If at any point, the average is less than 40, mark it as failed.

Continue reading all scores (even if failed), but remember the failure happened.

After reading all scores, print "No" if the student failed, otherwise "Yes".

💡 Intuition Behind the Code:
The goal is not to calculate the final average, but to monitor the average after each test.

This simulates a real-world grading system where students are expected to maintain a certain average throughout, not just at the end.

Even if the final average is above 40, one bad stretch early on could still mean failing.

✅ Code Explanation (in simple English):
The code starts by reading the number of test cases.

For each test case:

It reads the number of tests taken (N).

It initializes:

An array to store the scores.

A variable to keep the running sum of scores.

A flag (failed) to check if average ever drops below 40.

It then reads each score one-by-one:

Adds it to the running sum.

Calculates the average so far by dividing the sum by the number of tests so far.

If the average is ever less than 40, the student is considered failed, and the flag is marked.

Even if the student fails early, the code keeps reading the remaining inputs to avoid input mismatch issues.

At the end of the test case:

If the student ever failed, it prints "No".

Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

🧪 Example:
Input:
1
5
60 35 40 45 50
Step-by-step:
Test 1: Avg = 60 → ok

Test 2: Avg = (60 + 35) / 2 = 47.5 → ok

Test 3: Avg = (60 + 35 + 40) / 3 = 45 → ok

Test 4: Avg = ... → still ok

Never dropped below 40 → ✅ Print Yes

Input:
1
3
10 50 100
Test 1: Avg = 10 → ❌ Already failed

Even if next tests are good, student already failed
→ ❌ Print No

✅ Summary:
You're watching the student's average after every test.

If it ever drops below 40 → Fail

The code efficiently checks this by tracking the sum and average after each test.
