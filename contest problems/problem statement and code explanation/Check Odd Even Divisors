Check Odd Even Divisors
You are given two integers A and B. You want to determine whether there exists a positive integer N such that:
N has exactly A odd divisors, and
N has exactly B even divisors.

Examples
For N = 2, the divisors are {1, 2}
→ 1 odd divisor (1), 1 even divisor (2)
→ So (A = 1, B = 1) is possible

For N = 8, the divisors are {1, 2, 4, 8}
→ 1 odd (1), 3 even (2, 4, 8)
→ So (A = 1, B = 3) is possible

Your task is to check if there exists any such integer N for each test case.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain two integers: A and B.

Output Format
For each test case, output "Yes" if there exists an integer N that has exactly A odd divisors and B even divisors.

Otherwise, output "No".

You may print the output in any case (e.g., YES, yes, yEs, etc.).

Constraints :
1≤T≤10^4
