Problem Statement: Passing Grade

Chef is one of N students in his university class. His professor likes Chef but dislikes the rest of the class.

After grading the exams, the i-th student has scored A[i] marks. Chef is always student number 1, and the remaining students are numbered from 2 to N.

The professor cannot change the students’ scores, but he can decide the cutoff marks X (0 ≤ X ≤ 100). Any student with marks ≥ X passes, and those with marks < X fail.

The professor’s goal is:

Ensure Chef passes.

Fail as many other students as possible.

Task:
Determine the minimum number of students who pass if the professor chooses the cutoff optimally to satisfy the above goals.
