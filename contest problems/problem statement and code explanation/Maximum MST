Problem Statement: Maximum MST

You have a graph where every point is connected to every other point. Each connection (edge) has a number (weight) that tells how “heavy” it is.

The problem is, you know all the numbers, but you don’t know which number belongs to which connection.

Your task is to assign the numbers to the connections in a way that makes the total weight of the minimum spanning tree as large as possible.

A minimum spanning tree is a set of connections that connects all points together without any loops, using exactly enough connections to connect everyone.

Input:

First, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

Number of points in the graph.

A list of all the edge weights.

Output:

For each test case, print the largest possible total weight of the minimum spanning tree.
