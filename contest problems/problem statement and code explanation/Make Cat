🐱 Make Cat
Chef absolutely adores cats and is always on the lookout for them—even in the most unexpected places.

Today, Chef stumbled upon a string S consisting of exactly 3 lowercase English letters. He wonders:

Can he rearrange the letters of this string to form the word "cat"?

Your task is to help Chef answer this question.

📥 Input Format
A single line containing the string S, where |S| = 3.

Each character of S is a lowercase English letter ('a' to 'z').

📤 Output Format
Print YES if it's possible to rearrange the letters of S to form "cat".

Otherwise, print NO.

Output is case-insensitive. So YES, yes, Yes, etc., are all acceptable.

✅ Constraints
S is exactly 3 characters long.

S contains only lowercase English letters.

💡 Explanation
In the first example, the letters of "tac" can be rearranged to form "cat", so the answer is YES.

In the second example, the letters of "dog" cannot be rearranged to form "cat", so the answer is NO.
