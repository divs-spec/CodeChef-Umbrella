✅ Problem Name: Marble Collection

🧩 Problem Summary (in simple words):
You are a marble collector.

There are M total marble types available in the world.

You already have N marbles, but some of them may be of the same type.

You're given a list of the types of the marbles you own.

Your task:
Figure out how many marble types you are still missing from your collection.

📝 Input Format:
For each test case:

Two integers N and M

N = number of marbles you have

M = total number of marble types in the world

A list of N integers: each one represents the type of a marble you own

🎯 Goal:
Count how many types you don’t have yet.

💡 How to Solve (Logic & Approach):
Ignore duplicates:
If you have more than one marble of the same type, it still counts as only one type collected.
→ So we only care about the unique types in your collection.

Use a set or similar structure:
As you read each marble type, keep track of which unique types you've seen.

Subtract collected types from total types:
The number of missing types = M - number of unique types collected

🧪 Example Walkthrough:
Example:
Input:
1
5 7
1 3 3 2 5
Step-by-step:
You have 5 marbles, and there are 7 types in total.

The types you have: 1, 3, 3, 2, 5

Even though 3 appears twice, you only count it once.

So, your unique collected types are: 1, 2, 3, 5 → Total of 4 types collected

Missing types = 7 (total) - 4 (collected) = 3

Output:
3
🚀 Final Notes:
You're simply counting how many unique types you already have.

Then subtract that from the total possible types.

This is a typical set-based or frequency-count problem that tests your ability to ignore duplicates and focus on distinct elements.

✅ What the code is doing (in plain words):
It starts by reading how many test cases there are.
You might be asked to repeat the same task for multiple marble collections.

For each test case:

You are told how many marbles you currently have.

And how many different marble types exist in total.

The code reads the types of marbles you own.

Some marbles may be of the same type.

But you are only interested in how many different types you actually have.

To count the different types, it uses a set.

A set is like a bag that automatically ignores duplicates.

So if you add the same type twice, it only counts once.

Once all marbles are added to the set,
the number of unique types you own is simply the size of that set.

To find how many types you are missing:

Subtract the number of types you own from the total number of types.

This gives the number of types you don’t have yet.

It prints that number as the result.

You now know how many more types you need to complete your collection.

🎯 Intuition Behind It:
You only care about collecting unique types, not duplicates.

A set is the perfect tool to track uniqueness.

Once you know how many types you have,
just subtract it from the total to find how many are missing.

🧠 Key Idea:
You're counting what you already have, and then figuring out what's left to get.

That’s it — a smart, simple, and efficient way to solve the problem.
