💐 Decoration Discount
Chef has decided to spruce up his home with some new decorations. Specifically, he wants to buy exactly two flower vases.

He visits a store that has N vases displayed in a row. The price of the i-th vase is A[i]. It's guaranteed that all prices are even.

However, there's a special discount in the store:

If Chef buys the i-th vase, then the price of the (i+1)-th vase is halved.

This is the only discount available.

Your task is to help Chef determine the minimum total cost of buying two different vases, considering the discount rule.

📥 Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

The first line contains an integer N — the number of vases in the store.

The second line contains N space-separated even integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] — the prices of the vases.

📤 Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum total cost of buying two different vases, considering the applicable discount.

✅ Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100

2 ≤ N ≤ 100

2 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100, and all A[i] are even
