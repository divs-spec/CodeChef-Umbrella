Problem Statement :

Two Pile Game
Alice and Bob are having a tea party! Of course, there must be snacks at a tea party.
Laid out on the table in front of Alice and Bob are biscuits and cakes.
Initially, there are:
X biscuits
Y cakes
The two take turns eating snacks, with Alice going first.
On their turn, a player can do exactly one of the following:
Eat one biscuit → reduces X by 1, Y stays the same.
Eat one biscuit and one cake → reduces both X and Y by 1.
Eat one cake and add one biscuit → reduces Y by 1 and increases X by 1.

Rules:
The number of biscuits and cakes cannot go negative.
The player who eats the last snack is satisfied.
Both players play optimally to maximize their chances of being satisfied.

Task:
Given the initial values of X and Y, determine who will be satisfied in the end.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the initial number of biscuits and cakes.

Output Format
For each test case, print the winner’s name: "Alice" or "Bob".
Case-insensitive output is accepted (e.g., bob, BOB, Alice, ALICE).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^9
X + Y ≥ 1


Code Explanation :

This C++ program is made to check a simple rule for multiple test cases. 
First, it asks the user how many test cases there will be. 
This number is stored in the variable T. 
Then, the program goes through each test case one by one using a while loop.
For every test case, the program reads two numbers, X and Y. 
However, it only looks at X to decide the result. 
The rule is simple: if X is an odd number, the program prints "Alice". 
If X is an even number, it prints "Bob". The number Y is not used anywhere in the decision.
The program uses X % 2 == 1 to check if X is odd. 
Here, % is called the modulo operator and it gives the remainder after dividing by 2. 
Odd numbers have a remainder of 1, and even numbers have a remainder of 0.
The lines ios::sync_with_stdio(false); and cin.tie(nullptr); are there to make input and output faster, which is helpful when there are many test cases.
Finally, after checking all test cases, the program ends with return 0;, which simply means it finished successfully.
In short, this program reads a number X for each test case and prints "Alice" if X is odd, or "Bob" if X is even, ignoring the second number Y.
