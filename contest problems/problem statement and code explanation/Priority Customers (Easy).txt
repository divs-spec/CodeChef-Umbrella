🧩 Problem Summary
You are given N people standing in a line (queue). Each person has a priority level from 1 to N, and each priority value appears exactly once. That means the list is a permutation of 1 to N.

Your goal is to find the number of non-empty subsets of people such that:

In the chosen subset, every person has a higher priority than the person standing immediately before them in the original line.

In simpler terms:

You must select people in order (from left to right), but you can skip people.

However, whenever you include a person, they must have higher priority than the last person you included.

You want to count all such subsets (of size 1 or more) that satisfy this rule.

🧠 Understanding the Rules
Let’s break it down with a small example:

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3]
All valid subsets (in original order, skipping allowed, but increasing priority):

[1]

[2]

[3]

[1, 2]

[1, 3]

[2, 3]

[1, 2, 3]

Total: 7 subsets

Note: Subset [2, 1] is not valid, because 1 < 2 is not increasing.
The subset must follow the original order and have increasing priority.

✅ What You Need to Do
You are given:

T test cases.

For each test case:

Integer N (number of people)

List of N integers: the priorities in the queue.

You need to print, for each test case, the number of valid subsets as defined.

🔧 Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

1 ≤ N ≤ 20
→ Since N is small, 2ⁿ subsets is manageable (~1 million max), so brute-force or bitmask-based solutions are acceptable.

🧠 Key Observations
You are allowed to pick any subset of positions, as long as:

The order of positions is increasing (left to right), and

The priority values are strictly increasing.

This is similar to finding increasing subsequences, but you must count all such subsequences (not necessarily the longest).

Because N is small (≤ 20), you can use:

Backtracking / DFS

Bitmask enumeration (try all subsets and check validity)

🔢 Sample Input

3
4
1 2 3 4
5
3 4 1 5 2
5
5 1 3 2 4

🔢 Sample Output

16
9
14
Explanation for First Test Case:

All subsets that follow increasing priority:

[1], [2], [3], [4]

[1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]

[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,3,4], [2,3,4]

[1,2,3,4]

Total = 16 subsets

✅ Final Goal
For each test case, print the total number of valid non-empty subsets where:

Elements are taken in original order (you can skip)

Priorities are strictly increasing

You need to repeat this process for all T test cases and output the result for each.

Let me know if you want a sample brute-force or optimized code solution!


CODE EXPLAINATION :

This Java code solves a competitive programming problem using modular arithmetic and array manipulation. For each test case, it reads an array of size n. The goal is to compute an answer based on certain properties of the array, mainly involving increasing sequences and possible combinations.

First, the code precomputes powers of 2 modulo 998244353 and stores them in po[]. These represent the number of ways certain elements can be arranged or chosen.

It then identifies the longest strictly increasing suffix (from the end of the array), stopping early if it encounters a 1. The variable ind marks where this increasing suffix begins. The array vis[] is used to track which numbers have been seen so far.

The answer starts with 2^(n - ind), since the increasing suffix allows that many configurations. Then, the code iterates through the elements before ind, dynamically updating which elements are visited and adjusting ind forward as needed. For each step, it adds 2^(n - ind) to the answer.

Finally, it prints the result. The code uses BufferedReader and PrintWriter for fast input and output. Overall, it efficiently counts configurations based on increasing subsequences and visited values.
