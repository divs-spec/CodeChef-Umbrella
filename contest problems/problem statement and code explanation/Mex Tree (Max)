This Java code solves a tree problem using a smart technique called Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD) and Dynamic Programming (DP). Letâ€™s break it down in simple terms.

ðŸŸ© Problem Overview
You are given a tree (an acyclic connected graph). For every pair of nodes (x, y), we want to calculate a certain value based on how the tree is split into two parts when moving from x to y. The goal is to find the maximum such value across all possible pairs.

ðŸŸ© Tree Representation and HLD
The class HLD (Heavy-Light Decomposition) is used to break the tree into chains for fast calculations.

Important arrays in HLD:

siz[]: Size of subtree for every node.

top[]: Topmost node of the current chain.

parent[]: Parent of each node.

dep[]: Depth of each node.

in[] and out[]: Track entry/exit times in DFS.

adj[]: Adjacency list of the graph.

The work(root) method starts the decomposition from the root (node 0 here). It runs two DFS traversals:

dfs1: Computes subtree sizes and prepares heavy edges.

dfs2: Sets up chains and time indices.

This makes future calculations on the tree much easier.

ðŸŸ© Building Parent Table
We create a table par[x][y] where for each source x, par[x][y] gives the parent of y in the DFS tree rooted at x. This helps us move back in the tree when calculating answers.

ðŸŸ© DP to Solve the Problem
We define a DP function calc(x, y) that calculates the desired value for the node pair (x, y).

If x == y, we calculate how many pairs of nodes lie in different subtrees of x. This involves subtracting combinations inside each subtree from the total.

If x != y, we consider two ways:

Move x one step toward y and solve.

Move y one step toward x and solve.

At each step, we add the product of two subtree sizes â€” one from xâ€™s side and one from yâ€™s side. This models the number of node pairs that lie in different parts.

ðŸŸ© Main Logic
We call calc(i, j) for every pair (i, j) in the tree and keep track of the maximum result.

Finally, we print the maximum value as the answer.

ðŸŸ© Helper Methods
reverse(int[] arr): Reverses an array (not used in this version).

dfsParent(...): Builds the par[][] table.

rootedSize(...): Finds the size of a subtree with respect to a specific root. Important for understanding how the tree is split between x and y.

ðŸŸ© Summary
This code:

Builds the tree structure.

Prepares helper data using DFS and HLD.

Uses memoized DP to avoid repeated calculations.

Checks all node pairs and picks the best answer.

Itâ€™s efficient due to HLD and works well for trees with up to 2000 nodes.
