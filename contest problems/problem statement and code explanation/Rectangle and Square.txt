Problem: Rectangle and Square
You have a rectangle of length A units and breadth B units. You also have a square with side length of C units.

Check if both the rectangle and the square have the same area.
Print Yes if they have the same area, and No otherwise.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains 3 integers: A, B, and C.

Output Format
Output on a new line Yes if they have the same area, and No otherwise.

It is allowed to print each character in either case, i.e. YES, yes, yES, YeS will all be accepted as a positive response.

Constraints
1 ≤ 𝐴 , 𝐵 , 𝐶 ≤ 10
1 ≤ A , B , C ≤ 10

Explanation

In the first example: Rectangle area = 2×3 = 6, Square area = 3×3 = 9 → Not equal → Output: No

In the second example: Rectangle area = 2×3 = 6, Square area = 3×3 = 9 → Not equal → Output: No
