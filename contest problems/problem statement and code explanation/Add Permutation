Add Permutation
You are given a 1-indexed permutation 
P of the integers from 1 to N.
From this permutation, construct an array 
A of size N such that:
𝐴𝑖 = 𝑃𝑖 + 𝑖
Let f(P) be the number of distinct elements in the array 𝐴.

Example
Let 
P=[3,4,1,2]

Then the constructed array is:

A=[3+1,4+2,1+3,2+4]=[4,6,4,6]
So, the distinct values in 
𝐴
A are {4, 6}
Hence, 
f(P)=2

Task
Given integers N and K, you must construct a permutation 
P of integers from 1 to N such that:
f(P)=K
You only need to output one such permutation.
It is guaranteed that at least one valid solution always exists.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T – the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and K.

Output Format
For each test case, output a line with N integers – a valid permutation 
P of [1,2,...,N] such that f(P)=K.

If multiple answers are possible, any valid one will be accepted.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤K≤N≤100
