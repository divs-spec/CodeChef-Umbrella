❌ Leave No Witnesses
You're given a binary string A of length N, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

We define an integer X to be a witness for the string A if it satisfies the following condition:

🧠 Witness Evaluation Rule
For a given X (where 1 ≤ X ≤ N), construct two arrays:

S1: Initially empty
For every index i such that A[i] == '0', append (X & i) to S1
(here, & is the bitwise AND operation)

S2: Initially empty
For every index i such that A[i] == '1', append (X | i) to S2
(here, | is the bitwise OR operation)

After processing all indices i from 1 to N, if:

S1 ∩ S2 == ∅
(i.e. the two sets have no common elements),
then X is called a witness for the string A.

🎯 Your Goal
You are allowed to flip any number of bits in the string A. In one operation, you may:

Choose any index i (1 ≤ i ≤ N)

Flip A[i] from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'

Your task is to determine the minimum number of bit flips required to transform A into a binary string such that no integer X from 1 to N is a witness for the new string.

If it's impossible to create such a string, output -1.

📥 Input Format
The first line contains an integer T — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two lines:

An integer N — the length of the binary string

A binary string A of length N

📤 Output Format
For each test case, print a single line:

The minimum number of flips needed so that no integer in [1, N] is a witness for the new string

Or -1 if it's impossible

✅ Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10⁵ (number of test cases)

1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10⁵ (length of each binary string)

A[i] ∈ {'0', '1'}

The total sum of all N across all test cases will not exceed 2 × 10⁵

🔍 Example

Input:
2
3
010
2
11

Output:
1
-1

💡 Explanation

Test Case 1:
Original string: 010
For X = 2, S1 = [2 & 1, 2 & 3] = [0, 2], S2 = [2 | 2] = [2] → intersection not empty
If you flip the '1' to '0', string becomes 000, and now all S2 are empty.
So it's possible with 1 flip

Test Case 2:
No matter what flips are made, some X in [1, N] will remain a witness
So the answer is -1
