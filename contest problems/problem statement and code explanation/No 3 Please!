🔷 Problem Title: No Three Consecutive Primes
You are given a task to construct a sequence of N positive integers such that:

The sequence contains only distinct numbers.

The sequence does not contain three prime numbers in a row (i.e., three consecutive elements all being prime).

The maximum number in your sequence is as small as possible.

In simpler terms, you want to build a list of N different numbers that:

Avoids any triple of primes placed one after another.

Tries to keep all the numbers as small as possible.

✅ What are prime numbers?
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples of primes:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...

Examples of non-primes (also called composite numbers):
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...

🔶 What does “no three consecutive primes” mean?
If the sequence is:

[2, 3, 5] — ❌ invalid (all three are primes, and they are next to each other)

[2, 3, 4] — ✅ valid (only two primes in a row)

[3, 4, 5] — ✅ valid (only 2 primes with a non-prime between)

🧩 Your Goal
Build such a list of size N and print it.
Also, make sure:

All numbers are different

No three primes are together

The numbers are as small as possible

🔢 Input Format
One line with an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000)

📤 Output Format
Print N distinct integers separated by spaces

The sequence must follow the rules

🤔 Strategy
To build such a sequence, here’s a simple idea:

Start adding numbers from 1 onwards.

Keep track of how many primes are placed in a row.

If you’ve already placed 2 primes in a row, skip the next prime and add a non-prime instead.

Repeat until the sequence has N elements.

This way, you maximize the number of small values, while making sure three primes never appear together.

🧪 Example
If N = 5, a possible valid sequence is:

2 3 4 5 6

2 and 3 are prime ✅

4 is not prime ✅

5 is prime ✅

6 is not prime ✅
=> No three primes in a row ❇️

Another valid sequence: 1 2 3 5 6

There can be many valid answers as long as all conditions are followed.

🧠 Important Notes
You must print the actual sequence, not just count it.

The smallest maximum value in the list is preferred.

So always try to use the smallest possible numbers.

📌 Summary
Create a list of N distinct integers.

Don’t allow 3 primes next to each other.

Use the smallest numbers you can.

Print the sequence.
