💱 Currency Exchange
Chef currently possesses a stash of coins:

A₁ gold coins

B₁ silver coins

Chef is allowed to perform any number of the following three operations to transform his coins:

Gold to Silver

Pay 1 gold coin to receive 5 silver coins

Can only be performed if Chef has at least 1 gold coin

Silver to Gold

Pay 5 silver coins to receive 1 gold coin

Can only be performed if Chef has at least 5 silver coins

Discard Pair

Discard 1 gold coin and 1 silver coin

Can only be performed if Chef has at least 1 gold and 1 silver coin

Your task is to determine whether it is possible for Chef to end up with exactly:

A₂ gold coins

B₂ silver coins
by using the operations described above.

📥 Input Format
The first line contains an integer T — the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains 4 space-separated integers:
A₁ B₁ A₂ B₂ — the initial and target number of gold and silver coins, respectively.

📤 Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can reach the target state, or NO otherwise.

You may print the output in any case (e.g., yes, Yes, NO are all valid).

✅ Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

0 ≤ A₁, B₁, A₂, B₂ ≤ 1000

YES
YES
YES
💡 Explanation
Test Case 1:
Convert 5 silver → 1 gold, do this twice. Now: (4, 0). Discard 1 gold + 1 silver twice to reach (3, 0).

Test Case 2:
Discard 1 gold + 1 silver → (3, 4). Convert 1 gold → 5 silver → (2, 9), then discard (1, 8), then (0, 7), convert silver back.

Test Case 3:
Already at the target state!
